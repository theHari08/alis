# alis

Arch Linux Install Script (or alis) installs unattended, automated and customized Arch Linux system.

It is a simple bash script that fully automates the installation of a Arch Linux system after booting from the original Arch Linux installation media. It contains the same commands that you would type and execute one by one interactively to complete the installation. The only user intervention needed is to edit a configuration file to choose the installation options and preferences from partitioning, to encryption, bootloader, file system, language and keyboard mapping, desktop environment, kernels, packages to install and graphic drivers. This automation makes the installation easy and fast.

If some time later after an system update for any reason the system does not boot correctly a recovery script is also provided to enter in a recovery mode that allows to downgrade packages or execute any other commands to restore the system. Also a log of the installation can be taken with <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a>.

**Warning! This script can delete all partitions of the persistent storage. It is recommended to test it first in a virtual machine like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.**

Currently these scripts are for me but maybe they are useful for you too.

Follow the [Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux) of doing things and learn what this script does. This will allow you to know what is happening. 

Please, don't ask for support for this script in Arch Linux forums, first read the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) and the [General Recomendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/General_recommendations), later compare those commands with the commands of this script.

For new features, improvements and bugs fill an issue in GitHub or make a pull request. You can test it in a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual machine (strongly recommended) before run it in real hardware. If you test it in real hardware please send me an email to pico.dev@gmail.com with the machine description and tell me if something goes wrong or all works fine. [Pull request](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis/pulls) and [new feature request](https://github.com/picodotdev/alis/issues) are welcome!

### Installation

Download and boot from the latest <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">original Arch Linux installation media</a>. After boot use the following comands to start the installation.

Follow the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux">Arch Way</a> of doing things and learn what this script does. This will allow you to know what is happening. 

Internet connection is required, with wireless WIFI connection see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">Wireless_network_configuration</a> to bring up WIFI connection before start the installation.

```
# # Start the system with lastest Arch Linux installation media
# loadkeys [keymap]
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehari08/alis/master/download.sh | bash
# # Edit alis.conf and change variables values with your preferences
# vim alis.conf
# # Start
# ./alis.sh
```

### Recovery

Boot from the latest <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">original Arch Linux installation media</a>. After boot use the following comands to start the recovery, this will allow you to enter in the arch-chroot environment.

```
# # Start the system with lastest Arch Linux installation media
# loadkeys [keymap]
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehari08/alis/master/download.sh | bash
# # Edit alis-recovery.conf and change variables values with your last installation with alis
# vim alis-recovery.conf
# # Start
# ./alis-recovery.sh
```
